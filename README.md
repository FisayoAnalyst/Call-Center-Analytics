# Call Center Analytics

### Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of a telecom call center using Power BI. The objective was to uncover performance trends, evaluate agent efficiency, and identify opportunities to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The dataset, sourced from The Forage Virtual Experience Program, contains call records including agent details, call topics, resolution status, response time, and satisfaction ratings.

Through data cleaning, transformation, and visual storytelling, the dashboard highlights key insights such as peak call hours, abandonment trends, top-performing agents, and factors influencing customer satisfaction. Actionable recommendations were proposed to reduce call abandonment, enhance agent training, and optimize staffing during peak hours.
